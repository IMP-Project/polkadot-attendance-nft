## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)
- **Target**: Cleanup, contract, basic backend
- **Deliverable**: Working authentication and database

### Week 2: Integration (Days 8-14)  
- **Target**: Luma integration, blockchain minting
- **Deliverable**: Manual NFT minting works

### Week 3: Automation (Days 15-21)
- **Target**: Auto-minting, frontend, testing
- **Deliverable**: Complete MVP workflow

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
- [ ] **R1** Luma API rate limits - implement conservative polling
- [ ] **R2** Polkadot testnet stability - have backup RPC endpoints
- [ ] **R3** Contract deployment issues - test thoroughly on testnet
- [ ] **R4** Address validation edge cases - comprehensive testing
- [ ] **R5** Real-time polling performance - monitor resource usage

### Backup Plans (All Real, No Mocks)
- [ ] **B1** If Luma API unstable: Reduce polling frequency and show clear status
- [ ] **B2** If testnet down: Use alternative Polkadot testnet RPC
- [ ] **B3** If performance poor: Optimize polling intervals
- [ ] **B4** If auto-minting fails: Manual retry with real blockchain transactions
